              <p>The Coffee Ball is part of a new coffee capsule system the first of its kind that works entirely without capsules and generates zero waste. The company claims it is “revolutionizing an industry plagued by colossal waste,” and claims that capsule-coffee drinkers produce 100,000 tons of waste globally every year. Some pods are indeed recyclable or biodegradable, but most of them still end up in the trash. </p>

              <p>Have you tried the revelation that is Spanish coffee? Flaming Spanish coffee, that is? The name is a bit of a misnomer. It’s actually an American spin on the Spanish concept of carajillo: spiked coffee. But this drink is extra-special. It’s got a caramelized sugar rim and is spiked with Kahlua, rum, and orange liqueur…and topped with hand-whipped fluffy whipped cream! The burnt caramel, citrus, bitter coffee and sweet cream all <br>combine into a literal symphony of flavor. You’ve gotta try this one! </p>
